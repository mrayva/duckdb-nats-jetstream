The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [0.2.2] - 2026-08-05

### Added
- JetStream KV store support: point CRUD (`nats_kv_get`/`put`/`create`/`update`/`delete`),
  optimistic-concurrency updates, bulk `nats_kv_scan`/`nats_kv_history`, bucket lifecycle
  (`nats_kv_create_bucket`/`delete_bucket`, `nats_kv_status`), and `COPY TO ... (FORMAT nats_kv)`
- Incremental `since_revision` mode for `nats_kv_scan`
- Live KV watch job subsystem (`nats_start_kv_watch`, pause/resume/stop/status/jobs)
- CBOR and FlexBuffers payload extraction for `nats_scan`, ingest, and subscribe
- Structured `COPY TO` payload serialization for JSON, MessagePack, CBOR, FlexBuffers, and
  Protocol Buffers, including nested, repeated, and protobuf map fields
- `COPY FROM` ingest format
- Process-wide, modification-aware caching of parsed protobuf schemas

### Changed
- Upgrade to DuckDB v1.5.5, with compatibility support for both the pinned checkout and
  DuckDB "tip" APIs (`src/include/nats_duckdb_compat.hpp`)
- Vectorized scalar serialization paths for structured COPY TO, FlexBuffers, and protobuf output
- Reduced per-message payload copies and vectorized batch writes on the core NATS subscription path

### Fixed
- Various ingest and subscribe crash and correctness bugs

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- Support for repeated protobuf fields, serialized as JSON arrays
- Query cancellation support (Ctrl-C now interrupts long scans)

### Changed
- Deduplicate field path parsing into shared helper
- Reuse protobuf Message allocation per chunk instead of per row
- Replace per-cell SetValue with direct vector writes for envelope and JSON columns
- Move NATS connection and stream validation to init time (fail-fast on invalid streams)
- Remove dead code and redundant comments (-108 net lines)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-29

### Changed
- Upgrade to DuckDB v1.5.1 (from v1.4.2)
- Update extension-ci-tools to v1.5.1
- Update extension build output path for DuckDB 1.5 late linking layout

## [0.1.1] - 2025-11-05

### Fixed
- Payload column now returns BLOB instead of VARCHAR when no extraction parameters specified, preventing UTF-8 validation errors on binary data

## [0.1.0] - 2025-11-03

### Added
- Initial release of DuckDB NATS JetStream extension
- `nats_scan` table function for querying JetStream streams
- Sequence-based message retrieval with range queries
- Timestamp-based message retrieval with binary search
- JSON payload extraction with dot notation for nested fields
- Protocol Buffers payload extraction with schema support
- Support for Linux, macOS, Windows, and WebAssembly platforms
- CI/CD pipeline with multi-platform builds
